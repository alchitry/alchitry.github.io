# Features At A Glance

## 7-Segment Display

The Io has four seven segment LED digits that are multiplexed. Learning to use these if a great stepping stone to more complex projects.

## LEDs

There is a total of 24 LEDs in three groups of 8. Each one is directly connected to its own IO pin on the FPGA making outputting signals super easy.

## DIP Switches

The Io has three 8-pack DIP switches for a total of 24 switches. These are all also connected to their own IO pin on the FPGA making inputting values as simple as flipping a switch.

## Buttons

There are five buttons arranged in a standard directional pad style.

## Not-stackable

Because you need access to the top of this board, other boards can’t be stacked on top of it.
